# Json-Parser
This is a JavaScript Code.It runs on node as it uses fs module which is not available in browser.
Btw I parsed a file consisting of 40000 lines from it

It parses the json files and makes changes in it as follows

1-This program can read the JSON file,
locate the "level" values, and perform the required changes.

2- Implement a user interface in the C program that takes
input from the user through the Windows command prompt.

3- Allow the user to specify whether they want to change all "XX" values
or just a specific section identified by its "trid."

4-Prompt the user to enter a number to add or subtract from the current "level" value.

5-Update the JSON file with the new "level" values and save the changes.

6-Provide appropriate feedback to the user, confirming that the changes were made successfully.
